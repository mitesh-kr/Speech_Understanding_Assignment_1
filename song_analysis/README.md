# Audio Feature Analysis Tool

This Python script provides a tool for analyzing and visualizing audio features of different music genres. It uses PyTorch and torchaudio libraries to process audio files and generate waveforms and spectrograms.<be>

## Requirements
Libraries used in the project are the following: *torch*, *torchaudio*, *matplotlib*, *numpy*, *IPython*





 
You can install them using the following command
```[shell]
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## Features
Loads and plays audio files <be>
Displays audio waveforms <be>
Generates and visualizes spectrograms <be>
Supports multiple music genres (Classical, Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock) <be>
